## 1.0 system init & first build

<!--#TODO--- FUTURE PLAN ---------------------->

* tbd... after system is able to init and at least load data in Jinja usable variables, PUBLISH 1.0.0

* tbd... design `index.md` makes all sys init:
  * [ ] get req data from `dataapi.renware.eu`
  * [ ] te whole `JSON` data in small `JSON` chunks, like a smaller a more manageable entity
  * [ ] filter if necessary all `JSON` files
  * [ ] save final `JSON` files in `doc_src/data`
  * [ ] create data variables in `mkdocs.yml` that will be accessed in markdown pages (consider an extension of `mkdocs.yml`)

<!--#TODO --- end of FUTURE PLAN ----------------------->
